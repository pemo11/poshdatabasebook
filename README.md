A nice little book with many examples about how easily PowerShell handles database data

PowerShell + database is probably not a very common combination. Most PowerShell users if they aren't DBAs probably don't care much about database. 

But I was so many times really amazed how simple it is to access and process database data that I always wanted to provided all the Script that I have written over the last years as a book or at least as a repo.

So here it is. At its current state its more a collection of commented scripts that accomplish tasks like sorting or filtering large amounts of data within a DataTable or query data from an Oracle or SQLite database.

**Important**: This book is **NOT** about database administration so it has nothing to do with the typical DBA topics. I know a little about database administration but I would consider myself more like a "dummy" than a pro.

The book is about PowerShell and all the power it offers for dealing with all kind of data. If this data comes from SQL query or a webservice doesn't matter that much.

So what is it all about?
